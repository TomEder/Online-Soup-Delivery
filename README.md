# Online Soup Delivery

This is my implementation of the UX course at KYH. I created this in React after making a prototype in figma. Some changes have been made to the design.

## npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
